## Gold Prairie Website Archive

A reconstructed version of the home page of the Gold Prairie website found in the Internet Archive (archived on 07/05/2019):

[Internet Archive - www.goldprairie.com - July, 5 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190705221951/https://www.goldprairie.com/)

Site is a single static page; all nav bar items are non-functioning. It's recreated here as a sample of earlier work for my startup portfolio.

### Installation and setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the project for local dev -- this will run Vite and start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build the app for deployment & serve preview at `localhost:3000`

```bash
# Run the build command (vite build)
npm run build

# Preview the deployment locally using Vite as a server (vite preview)
npm run preview
```
